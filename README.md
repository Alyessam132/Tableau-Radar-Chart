# Football Analytics: Radar Charts for Player Assessment
## Introduction
Welcome to our project on using radar charts to assess football players' abilities and track various metrics over time. This tool is especially useful for comparing players in the same position.

# Challenge
One challenge we faced was that metrics often have different ranges and scales, potentially misleading comparisons. To address this, we used percentiles, which show the percentage of scores in a distribution that a particular score surpasses.

# Data Source
The data has been obtained from the Understat API, which focuses on metrics when the player has the ball, such as Goals, Assists, xG, xA, and Key Passes.

# Case Study: Jude Bellingham
In this project, we explore the evolution of the English player Jude Bellingham, from a promising young midfielder in 2021 to an all-around player in 2024.

# Comparison: Jude Bellingham vs. Kevin De Bruyne
We will also compare Jude Bellingham with Belgian player Kevin De Bruyne, one of the best playmakers in the world, highlighting his dominance in passing metrics such as Assists, Key Passes, xA, and xGChain. Bellingham, on the other hand, dominated scoring metrics such as goals, shots, and xG.
